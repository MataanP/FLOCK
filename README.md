# FLOCK
This project's goal is to use low level socket programming to simulate bird flock flight patterns.

The basic idea is that each computer in the network is in charge of calculating bird movements in its "air space". As birds naturally moved from one computer's air space to another, the task of calculating that bird's movements would shift to the new computer.
